+pls create a Time Tracker application for workers to track their times for different jobs the landingpage is the HoimeScreen where you cann add jobs to the list or choose a job which brings you to the JobScreen where you can start and stop the time count each time you stop a new time entry is made in the time entry list on the JobScreen. you can also print the times in that case you get a pdf file that you can print, share or save. another feature is the settings which can be accessed from every screen with a settings or gear icon which is shown as a small rectangle top right corner in the design. the settings can be looped through with a button click on either language or theme.
