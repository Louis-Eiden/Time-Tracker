+pls create a Time Tracker application for workers to track their times for different jobs the landingpage is the HoimeScreen where you cann add jobs to the list or choose a job which brings you to the JobScreen where you can start and stop the time count each time you stop a new time entry is made in the time entry list on the JobScreen. you can also print the times in that case you get a pdf file that you can print, share or save. another feature is the settings which can be accessed from every screen with a settings or gear icon which is shown as a small rectangle top right corner in the design. the settings can be looped through with a button click on either language or theme.

# 2024-11-24 15:34:27.515428
+cool I made some changes pls review and then make it so there is a second list for each day. so when a user creates a job and then starts to take time for the first time as soon as he stops a timeentry and also a day is created that means that the default list on the JobScreen shows the DayList when a user clicks on a day the list for this specific day is shown in place of the dayslist each day can have multiple timeentry.
