+pls create a Time Tracker application for workers to track their times for different jobs the landingpage is the HoimeScreen where you cann add jobs to the list or choose a job which brings you to the JobScreen where you can start and stop the time count each time you stop a new time entry is made in the time entry list on the JobScreen. you can also print the times in that case you get a pdf file that you can print, share or save. another feature is the settings which can be accessed from every screen with a settings or gear icon which is shown as a small rectangle top right corner in the design. the settings can be looped through with a button click on either language or theme.

+cool thats nearly perfectI will come back to that later can you pls add a context menu with three dots icon to each jobentry and each timeentry containing a edit and a delete button. IMPORTANT the context menu should only be visible on desktop devices on all mobile or touch devices the slide functionality should stay like it is. do not mess with the slide left slide right functionality pls!

+oh dont change the padding of the buttons and pls keep the context menu buttons on the right

# 2024-11-24 15:34:27.515428
+cool I made some changes pls review and then make it so there is a second list for each day. so when a user creates a job and then starts to take time for the first time as soon as he stops a timeentry and also a day is created that means that the default list on the JobScreen shows the DayList when a user clicks on a day the list for this specific day is shown in place of the dayslist each day can have multiple timeentry.

# 2024-11-24 15:47:54.966565
